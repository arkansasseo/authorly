              <p class="card-text">Designing your book&rsquo;s cover would be a cinch if you were a graphic designer. However, for those who are struggling in this highly regarded field of design, how do you survive? as a newbie, one helpful hint is to look into other children&rsquo;s books and see how they are designed. This will seem like your very own ocular inspection of best practices, so be keen at it. Look closely at the spines and the book face.

Recommendation: i strongly encourage you to hire someone to create a visually appealing cover for your work if you don&rsquo;t have the skills for this. Services such as elance can connect you with graphic designers at affordable prices.
