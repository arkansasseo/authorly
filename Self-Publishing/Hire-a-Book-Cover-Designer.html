		  <p>Designing your book&rsquo;s cover would be a cinch if you were a graphic designer. However, for those who are struggling in this highly regarded field of design, how do you survive? as a newbie, one helpful hint is to look into other children&rsquo;s books and see how they are designed. <img style="max-width: 20%; margin: 3px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557132061-5279073ae4d0?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MTE5fHxzZWxmLXB1Ymxpc2hpbmd8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE2NDQwNzYw\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="self+publishing" align="left" /> This will seem like your very own ocular inspection of best practices, so be keen at it. Look closely at the spines and the book face.</p>
<p>Even an ebook should have a cover, although it is not required. Amazon provides guidelines for uploading cover images and also includes a rather limited tool to create your own cover. Recommendation: i strongly encourage you to hire someone to create a visually appealing cover for your work if you don&rsquo;t have the skills for this. Services such as elance can connect you with graphic designers at affordable prices.</p>
<p>Until relatively recently, if you wanted to self-publish, you faced a labor-intensive and costly process. You had to handle every aspect of producing your book yourself, including hiring and overseeing editor(s), designer, cover artist, and printer. You had to order a print run, which meant you also needed somewhere to store a lot of boxes. Then, at the end of all that work and expense, you had to find a way to get your book into readers&rsquo; hands&mdash;an uphill struggle, since bookstore and library distribution wasn&rsquo;t available to individual authors, and paid publishing carried a powerful stigma.</p>
<p>I so adamantly believe that knowing how to conduct a ghostwriting interview is a bedrock of success that i wrote a book about it. While this book doesn&rsquo;t necessarily cover screenplay adaptation as this blog does, it does serve as a primer for a professional mentality with your writing. If you would like a complimentary copy of how to hire a ghostwriter: your guide to finding the best pro for your project all you have to do is click and download.</p>
<h3>Top Self Publishing Book Cover Trends for 2019</h3>
<p>This special summarizes tips and self-publishers. Bibr has coveres the self-publishing phenomenon since the magazine launched nearly six years ago. We've run a self-publishing column by victoria christopher murray in each issue, and we've highlighted practical advice in other features. To find earlier articles, see the bibr index on our web site: www. <img style="max-width: 70%; margin: 3px;" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574246604907-db69e30ddb97?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MXxzZWFyY2h8MjAyfHxzZWxmLXB1Ymxpc2hpbmd8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjE2NDQwNzYx\u0026ixlib=rb-1.2.1" alt="books" align="right" /> Bibookreview. Com, for specific topics and dates. You can purchase back issues of bibr from the web site or use the printed forms included in our back-issue advertisments (see page 57) in every issue.</p>
<p>I am going to be brutally honest with you here. You have as much chance of getting your manuscript published by a major publishing house as you do of winning the lottery. Less chance, perhaps. But, that is not why we write. We write in the hopes of one day being discovered, yes, but we mostly write because we cannot help ourselves. In some ways, all artists have a streak of masochism in them that makes them continue to try even when beaten down. And, you will be beaten down. You may receive hundreds of rejection letters. Each of those letters will eat a tiny bit of your soul.</p>
<p>Budget: $200-$500+ hiring the services of a professional book cover designer is one of your top priorities before self-publishing your book. It costs $500 or more to hire a good book cover designer, and like hiring an editor, you get what you pay for. Competitions on crowdsourcing websites like 99designs start at $240. That&rsquo;s a lot but a good cover is your book&rsquo;s best chance of standing out against the hundreds of thousands of others on stores like amazon.</p>
<p>Most people looking to write a book want to earn more money, gain more freedom or have a platform to share their ideas. When you self-publish and have complete ownership over your ideas, you also have complete ownership over your future. There is no traditional publishing firm to stop you from selling a supplementary online course that includes material from your book, starting a speaking career, re-releasing your book with a hardcover or audiobook, or even releasing an updated version of your book.</p>
